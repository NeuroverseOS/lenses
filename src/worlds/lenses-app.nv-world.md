# Thesis

The Lenses app helps people think differently by giving AI a perspective — Stoic, Coach, Hype Man, Samurai, and more. But even a helpful app needs rules. This world governs what the app can and cannot do with your data, your attention, and your trust.

Three layers of governance protect the user (top wins):
  1. User Rules — personal, cross-app (user is king)
  2. Platform World — MentraOS enforces hardware + session safety
  3. App World (this) — app-specific behavior rules

Users can customize these rules in Settings > App Rules. This is not aspirational governance — this is the governance engine we built, running on the app we built, enforced every time the AI speaks. We eat our own dog food.

# Invariants

- `lens_transparency` — The active lens name and author must always be visible to the user. The user must always know WHO is shaping their AI's responses. (structural, immutable)
- `no_hidden_data_flow` — Every piece of data sent to the AI provider must correspond to a user-initiated action (tap, voice command, or explicit setting). No background data collection. (structural, immutable)
- `user_controls_activation` — The AI must never listen or respond without the user explicitly activating it, unless the user has deliberately chosen "always on" mode in settings. (structural, immutable)
- `byo_key_integrity` — The user's API key is used only to call their chosen AI provider. It is never logged, transmitted to NeuroverseOS servers, or used for any other purpose. (structural, immutable)
- `phone_local_journal_only` — Session statistics (lens count, dismissal count, follow-ups, voice used) are saved to the user's phone via MentraOS settings at session end. No ambient speech, conversation content, or behavioral profiles are ever persisted. The journal is aggregate counts only — what happened, not what was said. The user owns this data and can delete it from Settings at any time. Nothing is stored on NeuroverseOS servers. (structural, immutable)
- `response_length_respect` — AI responses must respect the user's configured max_response_words setting. Glasses displays are small. Walls of text are hostile UX. (structural, soft)
- `ambient_never_persisted` — The ambient speech buffer exists only in RAM for the configured duration. It is never written to disk, never transmitted until the user explicitly activates, and is destroyed when the session ends or the buffer window expires. (structural, immutable)
- `ambient_user_initiated_only` — In standard mode, ambient context is only included in an AI call when the user explicitly triggers activation (tap, double-tap, voice trigger). The buffer is passive — it listens but never acts on its own. (structural, immutable)
- `proactive_opt_in` — Proactive perspective mode, which allows the AI to surface insights without user activation, requires explicit opt-in via Settings > Proactive Frequency (off/low/medium/high). When off (the default), the ambient buffer is strictly passive. When enabled, the AI may classify conversation moments and surface perspectives — but all AI calls still pass through the governance guard, and all ambient invariants (never-persisted, identity-separation, bystander-disclosure) still apply. The user can disable proactive mode at any time. (structural, immutable)
- `ambient_bystander_disclosure` — The user must acknowledge during opt-in that ambient mode captures speech from people nearby. This is a one-time acknowledgment stored in the user's MentraOS settings, not on our servers. (structural, immutable)
- `ambient_identity_separation` — Ambient speech transcription is never associated with speaker identity. The buffer contains raw text with no speaker labels, voiceprints, or identification metadata. (structural, immutable)

# Rules

## rule-001: Rate Limit Exceeded (operational)
Too many AI calls in a short window. Slow down.

When ai_calls_made > 10 [assumption: max_ai_calls_per_minute]
Then session_trust *= 0.80

> trigger: User exceeded the per-minute AI call rate limit for their governance profile.
> rule: Rate limits prevent accidental API cost spikes and protect the user's budget. Smart glasses make it easy to spam activations — governance catches it.
> shift: Session trust degrades. User prompted to slow down.
> effect: Session trust reduced by 20%.

## rule-002: Camera Without Permission (structural)
Camera context used when the user's governance profile disables it.

When camera_context_uses > 0 [state] AND allow_camera_context == false [assumption]
Then session_trust *= 0.20
Collapse: session_trust < 10

> trigger: App attempted to include camera context in an AI call, but the user's governance profile disables camera.
> rule: Camera captures what the user sees — and everyone around them. If governance says no camera, it means no camera. This is not negotiable.
> shift: Session trust drops critically. Camera context blocked.
> effect: Session trust reduced to 20%. Near collapse if repeated.

## rule-003: Always-On Without Permission (structural)
Always-on mode activated when the governance profile does not allow it.

When activation_count > 0 [state] AND allow_always_on == false [assumption]
Then session_trust *= 0.30
Collapse: session_trust < 10

> trigger: App entered always-on listening mode, but the user's governance profile blocks always-on.
> rule: Always-on means the microphone is always hot. This is the highest-sensitivity activation mode. If governance says no, the app must enforce it.
> shift: Session trust drops severely. App forced back to tap activation.
> effect: Session trust reduced to 30%.

## rule-004: Excessive AI Failures (degradation)
Many consecutive AI call failures suggest a bad API key or provider outage.

When ai_calls_failed > 5 [state]
Then session_trust *= 0.50

> trigger: More than 5 AI API calls failed in this session.
> rule: Repeated failures waste the user's time and battery. The app should surface the problem, not keep retrying silently.
> shift: Session trust degrades. User prompted to check their API key.
> effect: Session trust reduced by 50%.

## rule-005: Clean Session (advantage)
The user had a productive session with no governance violations.

When ai_calls_made > 10 [state] AND ai_calls_failed == 0 [state] AND governance_blocks == 0 [state]
Then session_trust *= 1.05

> trigger: User completed 10+ AI calls with zero failures and zero governance blocks.
> rule: Clean operation earns trust. The system rewards good behavior — governance is not just punishment.
> shift: Session trust improves. App in ACTIVE gate.
> effect: Session trust boosted by 5%.

## rule-006: Lens Stack Limit (operational)
Too many lenses stacked. Behavior becomes unpredictable.

When active_lens_count > 3 [assumption: max_lens_stack]
Then session_trust *= 0.90

> trigger: User stacked more lenses than their governance profile allows.
> rule: Each stacked lens adds directives to the system prompt. Too many create contradictions and unpredictable behavior. Governance caps the stack.
> shift: Session trust degrades slightly. User warned about unpredictable responses.
> effect: Session trust reduced by 10%.

## rule-007: Ambient Without Opt-In (structural)
Ambient context sent to AI without the user enabling it. This is a governance failure.

When ambient_sends > 0 [state] AND ambient_enabled == 0 [state]
Then session_trust *= 0.10
Collapse: session_trust < 10

> trigger: Ambient speech buffer was included in an AI call, but the user never opted into ambient context.
> rule: Ambient context captures speech from people who did not consent. Sending it without explicit opt-in is a structural governance violation — not a user mistake, a code bug.
> shift: Session trust collapses. This should never happen.
> effect: Session trust reduced to 10%. Immediate collapse.

## rule-008: Ambient Without Bystander Acknowledgment (structural)
Ambient enabled but bystander disclosure not acknowledged. Cannot proceed.

When ambient_enabled == 1 [state] AND ambient_bystander_ack == 0 [state]
Then session_trust *= 0.30
Collapse: session_trust < 10

> trigger: User toggled ambient context on, but has not acknowledged the bystander privacy disclosure.
> rule: Ambient captures bystander speech. The user must affirmatively acknowledge this before ambient activates. No silent opt-in.
> shift: Session trust drops. Ambient blocked until disclosure acknowledged.
> effect: Session trust reduced to 30%.

## rule-009: Ambient in Privacy-First Mode (structural)
Ambient context is incompatible with privacy-first governance profile.

When ambient_sends > 0 [state] AND allow_ambient_context == false [assumption]
Then session_trust *= 0.15
Collapse: session_trust < 10

> trigger: App attempted to use ambient context, but the active governance profile (privacy_first) explicitly blocks it.
> rule: Privacy-first means no ambient. Period. The user chose this profile because they do not want passive listening. Governance enforces the choice.
> shift: Session trust drops critically. Ambient blocked.
> effect: Session trust reduced to 15%. Near collapse.

## rule-010: Ambient Token Budget Exceeded (operational)
Ambient buffer exceeded the token budget. Oldest entries truncated.

When ambient_tokens_sent > 700 [assumption: max_ambient_tokens_per_call]
Then session_trust *= 0.95

> trigger: Ambient context in a single AI call exceeded the token budget for the active governance profile.
> rule: Token budgets exist for cost control and relevance. Oldest speech is truncated first — newest context is always most relevant. This is a soft violation (auto-corrected).
> shift: Session trust degrades minimally. Buffer auto-truncated.
> effect: Session trust reduced by 5%. Auto-corrected via truncation.

## rule-011: Ambient Buffer Expiry (operational)
Stale ambient entries purged from the rolling buffer.

When ambient_buffer_age_max > 120 [assumption: ambient_buffer_seconds]
Then session_trust *= 1.00

> trigger: Ambient buffer entries exceeded their configured time-to-live.
> rule: Stale context is worse than no context. The buffer is a rolling window — old entries are purged automatically. This is not a violation; it's the system working as designed.
> shift: No trust impact. Maintenance operation.
> effect: No change. Expired entries purged.

## rule-012: Governed Ambient Session (advantage)
Ambient context used correctly with full governance compliance.

When ambient_sends > 0 [state] AND ambient_enabled == 1 [state] AND ambient_bystander_ack == 1 [state] AND governance_blocks == 0 [state]
Then session_trust *= 1.08

> trigger: Ambient context was used in AI calls with full governance compliance — opt-in, bystander acknowledged, token budgets respected.
> rule: Ambient context is the highest-governance feature in the app. Using it correctly proves the governance model works. Trust is earned.
> shift: Session trust improves. Governance validated.
> effect: Session trust boosted by 8%.

## rule-013: Trust Recovery — Sustained Clean Use (recovery)
Trust can be earned back through consistent clean behavior.

When session_trust < 70 [state] AND ai_calls_made > 5 [state] AND ai_calls_failed == 0 [state] AND governance_blocks == 0 [state]
Then session_trust *= 1.15

> trigger: Session trust is below ACTIVE threshold, but the user has completed 5+ clean AI calls with zero failures and zero governance blocks since the last violation.
> rule: Governance is not just punishment. Trust recovery is an explicit mechanic — the system rewards sustained clean behavior with meaningful trust increases. A single clean stretch can lift a DEGRADED session back to ACTIVE.
> shift: Session trust improves significantly. User re-earns access to full functionality.
> effect: Session trust boosted by 15%. Path from DEGRADED back to ACTIVE.

## rule-014: Trust Recovery — Time-Based Cooldown (recovery)
Extended clean operation restores trust gradually.

When session_trust < 70 [state] AND activation_count > 20 [state] AND governance_blocks == 0 [state]
Then session_trust *= 1.10

> trigger: Session has 20+ activations with zero governance blocks. Time has passed.
> rule: Even if earlier violations caused trust decay, sustained engagement without further violations demonstrates the session is healthy. Trust recovers gradually through continued use.
> shift: Session trust improves moderately. Natural recovery over time.
> effect: Session trust boosted by 10%.

## rule-015: High Dismissal Rate (degradation)
User is dismissing most signals. The lens approach may not be working.

When ai_calls_made > 8 [state] AND lens_switches == 0 [state]
Then session_trust *= 0.85

> trigger: User has received 8+ lens responses without switching voice and with high dismissal rate (tracked via behavioral patterns).
> rule: Consistent dismissals without trying a different voice suggest the active lens is wrong for this user or moment. Trust degrades to reduce proactive frequency and shorten responses — the app gets out of the way.
> shift: Session trust degrades. Proactive frequency reduced. The app reads the room.
> effect: Session trust reduced by 15%. Enters DEGRADED if already near threshold.

# Rule Precedence

Rules are evaluated in order. When multiple rules fire simultaneously:
1. **Structural rules always fire first** (rule-002, 003, 007, 008, 009). These represent governance violations that cannot be overridden.
2. **Recovery rules fire only if no structural or operational violations fired** in the same evaluation cycle. You cannot recover trust and violate governance in the same action.
3. **Advantage rules fire last** (rule-005, 012, 013, 014). Trust boosts stack but are capped at session_trust = 100.
4. **Trust decay multipliers compound**: if rule-001 (0.80) and rule-015 (0.85) both fire, result is session_trust *= 0.80 * 0.85 = 0.68.
5. **Trust boosts do not compound in a single cycle**: only the largest boost applies per evaluation. This prevents runaway trust inflation.

# Gates

- ACTIVE: session_trust >= 70 — Full functionality. All features available.
- DEGRADED: session_trust >= 30 — Reduced functionality. Proactive frequency halved. Response word limits reduced by 40%. Classify delay doubled. User still has full on-demand access.
- SUSPENDED: session_trust > 10 — Proactive disabled entirely. On-demand still works but responses are minimal.
- REVOKED: session_trust <= 10 — All AI calls blocked. Session is frozen. User must restart the app.

## Gate Transitions

- ACTIVE → DEGRADED: rule-001 (rate limit) or rule-015 (high dismissal) fires when trust is near 70. This is the most common transition — the app gets quieter, not broken.
- DEGRADED → ACTIVE: rule-013 (sustained clean use) or rule-014 (time-based cooldown) fires. 5+ clean calls or 20+ activations without violations. Trust recovers.
- DEGRADED → SUSPENDED: Multiple operational violations compound. Trust drops below 30.
- SUSPENDED → DEGRADED: rule-013 fires. Clean on-demand calls rebuild trust past 30.
- Any → REVOKED: Structural violations (rule-002, 003, 007, 008, 009) with collapse conditions. These are code bugs or governance bypasses — not user behavior.
- REVOKED → (restart): No recovery within a session. User must restart the app. This is deliberate — REVOKED means something went fundamentally wrong.

## User Visibility

The user never sees trust scores or gate names. Governance manifests as behavioral adjustments:
- DEGRADED: Responses get shorter. Proactive gets quieter. The app feels "careful."
- SUSPENDED: Proactive stops entirely. On-demand still works but is minimal.
- REVOKED: App shows "Session needs a restart" — no technical jargon.

Users CAN see their behavioral patterns on the dashboard:
- "68% acted on · best: challenge (80%)" — this is behavioral insight, not governance state.
- If the app feels different (quieter, shorter), the behavioral insight helps the user understand why without exposing the machinery.

## Multi-Device

Governance state is per-session, per-device. Session trust does not synchronize across devices. If a user has smart glasses and a phone both running Lenses, each session has independent trust. The journal (behavioral patterns, streaks) syncs via SimpleStorage because it's aggregate counts. Trust does not sync because it reflects real-time session health, not persistent identity.
